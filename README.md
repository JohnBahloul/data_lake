## Overview

We can use Python and several open-source technologies, including Apache Hadoop, Apache Spark, and Apache Hive.


In this code, we first define the Hadoop configuration properties and create an HDFS client. We then define the path for the data lake directory and create it if it doesn't exist.

Next, we define the paths for the data sources and load them into Spark dataframes. We then merge the data sources into a single dataframe and select the columns we want to include in the data lake.

We write the merged data to the data lake directory in Parquet format and create an external Hive table for the data lake.

This code can be run on a Hadoop cluster to create a data lake that consolidates data from multiple sources into a centralized, scalable repository for analysis.
